### A tiny Python utility that shows you the local git branches in the current directory along with the last commit date on those branches.  
Do you want an overkill Python script that will tell you what local git branches you have in your current directory?  
Git-the-Branch will do it for you.  
This is a play project for me to get familiar with GitPython.  

#### Requirements  
- Requires Python 3.6+
- Requires that you have the GitPython package installed (see requirements.txt).  

#### Usage
Just run the Python file, with a, `python /path/to/gtb.py`  
And it will tell you what local git branches exist in your current folder.
